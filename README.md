# Variable Finder
 Find variables and also pointer variables from a source code file though outputting the variable and line number to a text file, only planned for cpp header files

 Steps 
 1. Run the file in a folder
 2. A file prompt will appear, then pick your source code file. (Suggestion choose header files)
        In the same folder two files will appear; "OutputCPP.txt" and "Output_Debug.txt".
 3. Open "OutputCPP.txt" file to see the variables in your source code.

 Output_Debug.txt copies the source file and adds a debugger info so we can check manually what we detected.
